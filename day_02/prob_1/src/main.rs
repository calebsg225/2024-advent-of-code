/*

- input contains lines of text
- each line contains a number of space-separated intergers representing levels

- for a level to be considered 'safe':
    1) the levels must all either increase or decrease
    2) the distance between 2 consecutive levels must be between 1 and 3 (inclusive)

Given these requirements, calculate the number of 'safe' levels in the input
